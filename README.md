# odin-etchasketch
This project was part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> Foundations curriculum.
We were asked to create a project recreating the famous Etch-a-sketch using HTML, CSS, and JS.

<p>This project was meant to demonstrate my use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
  <li>Use of Event Listeners</li>
  <li>Use of loops</li>
  <li>CSS Styling</li>
</ul>

## Objectives
<ol>
  <li>Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.</li>
  <li>Create the divs using Javascript instead of making them with HTML.</li>
  <li>Put the created divs inside a "container" div.</li>
  <li>Make the the divs appear as a grid using <b>Flexbox</b></li>
  <li>Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would</li>
  <li>Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.</li>
</ol>
